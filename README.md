# nagaozen fast OS initialization

I'm currently using a Manjaro/XFCE + gedit 2.30.4 (a bit modified) setup for my daily work.

## `/home/nagaozen/`

This package provides a `/home/nagaozen/` which probably doesn't exists in your system, so just copy the contents from inside this folder to your own user folder. Don't forget the dot folders (the invisible ones).

## et cetera

Just merge all folders, except `/home/` as mentioned before, to the file system `/`.
